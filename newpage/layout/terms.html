<div class="hrDotted"></div>
<h3>SECTION 6: THIRD PARTY APPS</h3>
<p>Wave Telecom's Service allows you to install or utilize certain Third Party Apps ("Apps").

<li>Other changes to increase performance or security of your website.</li>
</ol>
<p>Wave Telecom will make it clear whenever a feature will modify your content and, whenever possible, provide you a mechanism to allow you to disable the feature.</p>
</div>
<div class="hrDotted"></div>
<h3>SECTION 8: RECORDS OF Wave Telecom.COM VISITOR USE AND ABUSE</h3>
<p>As a visitor to Wave Telecom.com and a user of the Wave Telecom Service, you consent to having your Internet Protocol address recorded and your activities monitored to prevent abuse.</p>
<div class="hrDotted"></div>
<h3>SECTION 9: RECORDS OF YOUR VISITORS</h3>
<p>As part of the Wave Telecom Service, you may choose to monitor the traffic to certain websites. In doing so, you acknowledge that Wave Telecom acts as your limited agent (and data processor in the EU context) to you for the purpose of providing Internet data and optimization services. You acknowledge that it is your responsibility to ensure that the use of Wave Telecom's Service is permitted under the laws of your jurisdiction and you agree to indemnify and hold Wave Telecom harmless if your use of the Service is in violation of local law.

<div class="hrDotted"></div>
<h3>SECTION 10: LIMITATION ON NON-HTML CACHING</h3>
<p>You acknowledge that Wave Telecom's Service is offered as a platform to cache and serve web pages and websites and is not offered for other purposes, such as remote storage. Accordingly, you understand and agree to use the Service solely for the purpose of hosting and serving web pages as viewed through a web browser or other application and the Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) protocol or other equivalent technology. Wave Telecom's Service is also a shared web caching service, which means a number of customers' websites are cached from the same server. To ensure that Wave Telecom's Service is reliable and available for the greatest number of users, a customer's usage cannot adversely affect the performance of other customers' sites. Additionally, the purpose of Wave Telecom's Service is to proxy web content, not store data. Using an account primarily as an online storage space, including the storage or caching of a disproportionate percentage of pictures, movies, audio files, or other non-HTML content, is prohibited. You further agree that if, at Wave Telecom's sole discretion, you are deemed to have violated this section, or if Wave Telecom, in its sole discretion, deems it necessary due to excessive burden or potential adverse impact on Wave Telecom's systems, potential adverse impact on other users, server processing power, server memory, abuse controls, or other reasons, Wave Telecom may suspend or terminate your account without notice to or liability to you.</p>
<div class="hrDotted"></div>
<h3>SECTION 11: INVESTIGATION</h3>
<p>Wave Telecom reserves the right to investigate you, your business, and/or your owners, officers, directors, managers, and other principals, your sites, and the materials comprising the sites at any time. These investigations will be conducted solely for Wave Telecom's benefit, and not for your benefit or that of any third party. If the investigation reveals any information, act, or omission, which in Wave Telecom's sole opinion, constitutes a violation of any local, state, federal, or foreign law or regulation, this Agreement, or is otherwise deemed harm the Service, Wave Telecom may immediately shut down your access to the Service. You agree to waive any cause of action or claim you may have against Wave Telecom for such action, including but not limited to any disruption to your website. You acknowledge that Wave Telecom may, at its own discretion, reveal the information about your web server to alleged copyright holders or other complaintants who have filed complaints with us.</p>
<div class="hrDotted"></div>
<h3>SECTION 12: INDEMNITY</h3>
<p>You agree to indemnify and hold Wave Telecom, and its subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, agents, co-branders or other partners, and employees, harmless from any claim or demand, including reasonable attorneys' fees, arising out of your use of the Service, your connection to the Service, your violation of the Terms of Service, or your violation of any rights of another.</p>
<div class="hrDotted"></div>

<h3>SECTION 14: TERMINATION</h3>
<p>Wave Telecom's policy is to investigate violations of these Terms of Service and terminate repeat infringers.

You further acknowledge and agree that notwithstanding any termination, your obligations to Wave Telecom set forth in Sections 2, 3, 4, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13, 23, 24, 25 and 26 shall survive such termination.</p>
<div class="hrDotted"></div>

<div class="hrDotted"></div>
<h3>SECTION 17: LINKS</h3>
<p>The Service may provide, or third parties may provide, links to other websites or resources.

You further acknowledge and agree that Wave Telecom shall not be responsible or liable, directly or indirectly, for any damage or loss caused or alleged to be caused by or in connection with use of or reliance on any such content.</p>
<div class="hrDotted"></div>
<h3>SECTION 18: PUBLICITY</h3>

<div class="hrDotted"></div>
<h3>SECTION 20: WAIVER</h3>
<p>The failure of Wave Telecom to exercise or enforce any right or provision of this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.

<h3>SECTION 21: SEVERABILITY OF TERMS</h3>

<div class="hrDotted"></div>
<h3>SECTION 22: NON-TRANSFERABILITY OF ACCOUNTS</h3>

<h3>SECTION 23: TIME LIMITATIONS FOR CLAIMS</h3>

<div class="hrDotted"></div>
<h3>SECTION 24: APPLICABLE LAW</h3>
<p>By visiting Wave Telecom.com, you agree that the laws of the United States and, specifically, those of the state of California, without regard to principles of conflict of laws, will govern these Conditions of Use and any dispute of any sort that might arise between you and Wave Telecom or its affiliates. Any dispute or claim arising out of or in connection with this Agreement shall be adjudicated in San Francisco County, California, USA.</p>
<div class="hrDotted"></div>
<h3>SECTION 25: ARBITRATION</h3>
<p>In the case of any disputes under this Agreement, the parties shall first attempt in good faith to resolve their dispute informally, or by means of commercial mediation, without the necessity of a formal proceeding.</p>
<p>Any controversy or dispute arising out of or relating to this Agreement, or the breach thereof, which cannot otherwise be resolved as provided above shall be resolved by arbitration conducted in accordance with the commercial arbitration rules of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") and judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitral tribunal may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The arbitration tribunal shall consist of a single arbitrator mutually agreed by the parties, or in the absence of such agreement within thirty (30) calendar days from the first referral of the dispute to the AAA, designated by the AAA. The place of arbitration shall be San Francisco, California, U.S.A., unless the parties shall have agreed to another location within fifteen (15) calendar days from the first referral of the dispute to the AAA. The arbitral award shall be final and binding. The parties waive any right to appeal the arbitral award, to the extent a right to appeal may be lawfully waived. Each party retains the right to seek judicial assistance: (i) to compel arbitration; (ii) to obtain interim measures of protection prior to or pending arbitration, (iii) to seek injunctive relief in the courts of any jurisdiction as may be necessary and appropriate to protect the unauthorized disclosure of its proprietary or confidential information, and (iv) to enforce any decision of the arbitrator, including the final award.</p>
<p>The arbitration proceedings contemplated by this Section shall be as confidential and private as permitted by law. To that end, the parties shall not disclose the existence, content or results of any proceedings conducted in accordance with this Section, and materials submitted in connection with such proceedings shall not be admissible in any other proceeding, provided, however, that this confidentiality provision shall not prevent a petition to vacate or enforce an arbitral award, and shall not bar disclosures required by law.</p>
