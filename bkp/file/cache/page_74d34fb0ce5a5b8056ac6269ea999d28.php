<h2>Wave Telecom is the next-generation CDN</h2> 
<p>Wave Telecom designed its CDN (Content Delivery Network) without the legacy of the last 15 years. Our proprietary technology takes advantage of recent changes to hardware, web server technology and network routing. In other words, we’ve built the next-generation CDN. The result is a CDN that is easier to setup, more affordable, and performs better than any legacy CDN you\'ve tried before.</p>
<div class="cdn-map"></div>
<p>We build our hardware from the ground up, which means that we choose the hardware components down to the chip level. Our proprietary software allows us to process millions of requests per second efficiently. We run our own network, so we choose the exact location of our edge nodes&mdash;the most strategic points on the Internet. This is essential to ensure your visitors get the fastest page load times and best performance.</p>
<p>Wave Telecom’s CDN reduces hops and lowers latency. On average, a request is fewer than 10 hops and takes less than 30ms. The result? <strong>Your website gains a global presence on an affordable budget.</strong></p>

<h4>Wave Telecom makes your site faster</h4>
<p>Wave Telecom operates out of 23 data centers around the world. Our CDN automatically caches your static files at our edge nodes so these files are stored closer to your visitors while delivering your dynamic content directly from your web server. Wave Telecom then uses a technology called Anycast to route your visitors to the nearest data center. <strong>The result is that your website, on average, loads twice as fast for your visitors regardless of where they are located.</strong></p>
<p>On average, a website on Wave Telecom loads twice as fast for its visitors, sees <strong>65% fewer requests and saves 60% of bandwidth</strong>. You’ll be able to see the exact speed benefits and savings with your personalized <a href="aad.html">Wave Telecom analytics</a> report for your site.</p>
<h4>We never charge for bandwidth</h4>
<p>Wave Telecom will never bill you for bandwidth usage. We believe if your site suddenly gets popular or suffers an attack, you shouldn\'t have to dread your bandwidth bill. Wave Telecom charges a flat rate per <a href="parallels-plans.html">plan</a>, which is based on functionality.</p>

<h4>How can Wave Telecom offer a free service?</h4>
<p>Wave Telecom believes that every website should be fast. Because of Wave Telecom’s technology, we’ve been able to build a CDN that is available to any website online. From the beginning, we worked to minimize the costs of serving every byte. Wherever possible, we use our own custom-built systems that are designed for this purpose. We buy our bandwidth through the wholesale market, which means we\'re paying for the size of our pipe, not for each byte we serve through it. We also peer with other networks wherever possible in order to drive the cost of bandwidth as close to zero as possible. We never charge for bandwidth and are committed to always offering a FREE version of Wave Telecom with at least today’s feature set. Wave Telecom offers additional plans and services which offer even better services at reasonable prices. We hope you love the service and choose to upgrade.</p>
